User:
- Many small bugfixes for FF 45.0

Technical:
- global keystore deprecated (Application.storage.get/set) replaced by JS code module
- many const to var
- typo in js code (FhcPreferences.js)
- images displayed in html-page from chrome URL (when storing fields manually) replaced by pure css
- resolve severe mozilla validator warning: obsolete extension manager interface removed
- renamed "sessionstore-state-write" (removed) to the more appropriate "sessionstore-state-write-complete"

ToDo:
- Preferences overlay does not work in FF >= 36.0 (is no longer a dialog, is opened inside tab)\
- Many changes needed to support Multiprocess Firefox (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox)
- Prevent formhistory for specific fields (not related to a domain)
